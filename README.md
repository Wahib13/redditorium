# Redditorium
## Summary
A personal data-driven project that aims to understand and summarize Reddit activity patterns. Summarize both my own feed and feeds from specific communities. 
Main goal: reduce doom-scrolling and explore how online attention predicts real-world trends.

I built this tool to reduce doom-scrolling and help myself stay informed efficiently. Instead of endlessly scrolling Reddit, I get a smart, 3-minute daily digest of whatâ€™s trending and what I actually care about.
